# SAFE network

This was the project we developed for our Hackathon, the final event of our programming bootcamp. In 24 hours we had to come up with the idea, execute it and present it to our fellow Code Cadets, Master Coders, IT company representatives and more.

## The Idea

We were given a theme and song to extrapolate from. The theme was 'Push and Pop' and the song was 'Womanizer' by Britney Spears. We took the songs main message about guys who cheat on their partners and felt that we could talk about a really sensitive and powerful subject: abuse. 
SAFE stands for Strong And Fearless Equality and it is a network for everyone. People who are in danger, people who think they might be in danger, people who wanna know if a friend of theirs is in danger. At SAFE you can talk to experts and receive help depending on your situation. You can also register as a therapist with your license and be part of the many therapits that are involved in the network.

## The Development

Every creator that was involved in this project met 1 day before we were given the theme to our ptoject. We managed to have a great communication and to work as a great team. First, all of us talked about the strengths and what we were going to be comfortable working on which resulted in a very good workflow for both backend and frontend developers.

## My Role

I was assigned the frontend of the project and so I was pair-programming with my colleague Bernardo. So our job was to build the Javascript MVC architecture that could be able to consume the API that our backend team had build in Java. We managed to do that very well and everything ran smoothly. 

## Tech && Methodologies

Java, Javascript, Mac OS, Spring MVC, Javascript MVC, Hibernate, MySQL, Tomcat, Maven, Git, Scrum, HTML5, CSS3, Thymeleaf, IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code.

## How to use
In order to connect to our application, use maven $mvn tomcat7:deploy to deploy the project to your local tomcat service. Tomcat should be configured for localhost:8080 - if not, please update the project files. Open the http://localhost:8080/ in any browser and you should be ready to go.
