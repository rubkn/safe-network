        'Domestic violence cases increase in Lisbon',
        'Portugal''s public prosecutor received 3,487 cases of domestic violence offences in Lisbon district between January and March, according to official figures released on Wednesday...',
        'Portugal''s public prosecutor received 3,487 cases of domestic violence offences in Lisbon district between January and March, according to official figures released on Wednesday.<br>Around 2,700 cases were registered in the same period in 2018.<br>
        The statistics issued by Lisbon''s public prosecutor''s office also show that 1,958 cases were shelved between January and March this year.
        In recent months activists have taken the streets to protest domestic violence, which has already killed 12 women this year.
        In 2018, 28 women in Portugal were killed through domestic violence.<br>
        Activists and experts point out that domestic violence abusers are given lenient judgements and have called for an end to victim-blaming and what they call sexist court rulings.
        <br>
        In 2017, a Portuguese man who attacked his wife was not sent to prison because the judge deemed - citing the Old Testament - that his reaction was somewhat reasonable because she had committed adultery.<br>',

        'Portugal: Over 500 women murdered in the last 15 years, 28 in 2019',
        'More than 500 women have been murdered in the last 15 years in the context of family relations in Portugal, and this year alone 28 have died, some shot, others strangled or beaten...',
        'More than 500 women have been murdered in the last 15 years in the context of family relations in Portugal, and this year alone 28 have died, some shot, others strangled or beaten, most of them were victims of domestic violence.<br>
        The data are from the Observatory of Murdered Women (OMA) of the Union of Alternative and Responsive Women (UMAR) and appear in the preliminary report that was presented in Lisbon, covering 1 January to 12 November.<br>
        During this period the OMA counted 28 women murdered in the context of family relationships, two others killed in different contexts, and 27 attempted murders.<br>
        On average, there were three women murdered every month and an average of five women victims of forms of extreme violence.<br>
        53% of the murdered women had an intimate relationship with the killer, while 21% had already tried to break off the relationship. The majority (71%) of the murdered women were victims of violence in this relationship.<br>
        The OMA registered the existence of 45 children of the dead women, 26 were children from a previous relationship and 19 were children of the victim and the killer. In total, 16 were minors, which leads UMAR to ask for special attention for the child victims of gender crimes and for the children who are orphaned.<br>
        Most femicides were recorded in women aged between 36 and 50 years old(43%), followed by above 65 (21%), and half of the victims had jobs.<br>
        This data leads UMAR to argue for an increase in protection of these women and the creation of specific structures to cope with elderly women, especially in areas farther away from large urban centres.<br>
        The highest number of murders (seven) was in January, followed by February, August and October, with three deaths each, and no homicide was recorded in November.<br>
        Most women (13) were killed using a firearm, but there were also eight cases of women being stabbed, three being beaten, three being strangled or one killed by asphyxiation.<br>',

        'Two arrests for domestic violence every day as Portugal approaches first “day of mourning”',
        'With March 7 set for the first national day of mourning for women killed by their partners, RTP news has revealed that since the start of 2019 there have been an average of two...',
        'With March 7 set for the first national day of mourning for women killed by their partners, RTP news has revealed that since the start of 2019 there have been an average of two arrests per day for domestic violence.<br>
        In January and February alone, 10 women lost their lives, and one small child – strangled to death by her own father.<br>
        It has been a truly terrible start to the year which has led prime minister António Costa''s right hand woman Mariana Vieira da Silva, recently promoted to minister of the presidency, to announcing new investment towards the combat of domestic violence.<br>
        With work now being done behind the scenes, Vieira da Silva''s first move has been to declare March 7 (the day before International Women''s Day) as the first day of national mourning for victims.<br>
        She told reporters ahead of yesterday''s Council of Ministers, “this day is a day in which we should not just remember the victims but show support to their families and collectively renew our sense of purpose towards addressing this fight”, which Lusa news agency explains is a fight that the new minister feels everyone in society should support.<br>
        “The more aware society is that (domestic violence) is a crime, the more likely we will be to eliminate it”, said Mariana Vieira da Silva.<br>
        Ironically, the day the March 7 date was announced, RTP claims four arrests were made for domestic violence, bringing the total number of arrests so far to 126.<br>
        Most of the suspects facing charges are men, and in some cases they have not just been arrested for attacking or threatening partners or former partners, but for menacing their own children.<br>',

        'Portugal: Over 500 women murdered in the last 15 years, 28 in 2019',
        'In its first report on the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (“Istanbul Convention”)...',
        'In its first report on the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (“Istanbul Convention”) by Portugal, the Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO) acknowledges the significant commitment of the Portuguese authorities and the progress achieved. However, the report also points out a number of shortcomings and recommends measures to improve the protection of victims, the prosecution of offenders, as well as prevention measures.<br>
        Following the ratification by Portugal of the convention in 2013, the scope of public policies was widened and other forms of violence against women such ask stalking, female genital mutilation (FGM) and forced marriage were criminalised. GREVIO welcomes the efforts in the area of FGM that resulted in three consecutive programmes of action specifically targeting this form of violence, which makes Portugal a pioneer in the area. GREVIO calls on Portugal to develop long-term programmes addressing all forms of violence covered by the convention and to build on progress already achieved.<br>
        GREVIO praises the role the national co-ordination body (CIG) to ensure implementation, monitoring and evaluation of gender-equality policies and gender-based violence. Nevertheless, it finds that the implementation of national action plans on violence against women would benefit from a more robust co-ordination between the governmental agencies. At the operational level, the impact of Law No.112/2009 on domestic violence could be improved, in particular by means of a greater involvement of local authorities.<br>',

        'More than 400 people marched in silence in Lisbon on Sunday to show their solidarity with the victims of domestic violence in Portugal as nine women have lost their lives already this year.<br>
        "We are united here today in an exercise of pure citizenship. We are trying to mobilise people around a common cause in favour of the victims and against violence”, said Joana Marques, one of the organisers, stressing that the organisation was not connected “with any political party, union or association”.<br>
        The marchers led with a black banner bearing phrases such as “The victim is not to blame, the perpetrator is”, “Violence is the weapon of the mediocre” and “A person who beats someone, attacks all of society”. According to the Portuguese Observatory of Assassinated Women, nine women have been killed in domestic violence since the beginning of the year. A total of 28 women were murdered last year. On Thursday, the government announced it was setting up domestic violence victim support offices in the police criminal investigation departments and bolstering the articulation and cooperation among security forces, magistrates and organisations that work on prevention and fighting domestic violence.<br>',
